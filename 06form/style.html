            <ol>
                <li>Prehistoric<br>
                    The representation of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength.
                </li>
                <li>Egyptian<br>
                    A civilization with very strong traditions of architecture and sculpture.
                </li>
                <li>Greek and Roman<br>
                    Had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects.
                </li>
                <li>Gothic</li>
                <li>Renaissance</li>
                <li>Modern Art<br>
                    This often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used.<br>
                    To see this kind of art you can visit the <a href="https://www.moma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Museum of Modern Art</a>.

                <li>Impressionism<br>
                    Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself.
                </li>
                <li>Abstract<br>
                    Uses a visual language of form, color, and line to create a composition that may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.
                </li>
