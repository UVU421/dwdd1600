            <p>The history of painting reaches back in time to artifacts and artwork created by pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, continents, and millennia, the history of painting consists of an ongoing river of creativity that continues into the 21st century. Until the early 20th century it relied primarily on representational, religious and classical motifs, after which time more purely abstract and conceptual approaches gained favor.<br>
            Developments in Eastern painting historically parallel those in Western painting, in general, a few centuries earlier.

            <h2><a href="style.html#style">Oldest Known Paintings</a></h2>
            <p>There is much debate over what is the oldest known painting and people are constantly finding new pre-historic paintigs that could be the oldest painting ever found. Here are 4 that have been found to be some of the oldest</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Approximately 40,000 years old in the caves in the <em>district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia)</em> The oldest type of cave paintings are hand stencils and simple geometric shapes</li>
                <li> Over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of <em>Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h on the Indonesian island</em></li>
                <li>Figurative cave paintings depicting pig hunting in the <em>Maros-Pangkep karst in Sulawesi</em> were estimated to be even older, at least 43,900 years old</li>
                <li>Cave art of a pig found in an <em>Indonesian island</em>, and dated to over <strong>over 45,500 years</strong>, has been reported</li>
            </ul>
